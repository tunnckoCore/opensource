## Usage

```js
module.exports = {
  presets: 'babel-preset-optimise',
};
```

_**Note:** initially it was meant to be called `babel-preset-optimize`, but the
package was squatted before I get able to push all this things_

## What it includes?

It uses the most recent and modern preset by the Babel Team -
[@babel/preset-modules](https://ghub.now.sh/@babel/preset-modules), plus
optionally the TypeScript and the React presets. It also includes a several
optimization plugins from the Babel Minify project which are very well curated
for best and small output.
